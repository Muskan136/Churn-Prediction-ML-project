# Churn-Prediction-ML-project
In this project, I analyzed customer churn data for a telecommunications company to predict which customers are likely to leave. I began with data cleaning and exploration to identify patterns related to churn, using visualizations and statistical methods. Then, I built and tested machine learning models, including Decision Trees, to predict churn, and improved model performance by handling class imbalance with techniques like SMOTEENN. The result was a predictive model that helps understand key factors driving customer churn and provides actionable insights for retention strategies.
